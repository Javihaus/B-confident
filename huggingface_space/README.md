# B-Confident: Interactive Uncertainty Quantification Demo

Enterprise-grade uncertainty quantification for Large Language Models using Perplexity-Based Adjacency methodology. This interactive demo allows you to explore how uncertainty quantification behaves across different model architectures and understand the operational value of calibrated confidence measures.

## What This Demo Shows

**Infrastructure for reliable deployment of current transformer architectures** - This tool provides essential infrastructure for regulatory compliance and production reliability, clearly distinguished from fundamental advances in AI architecture.

### Key Demonstrations

1. **Multi-Model Uncertainty Comparison**: See how PBA performs across GPT-2, DistilBERT, and other architectures
2. **Calibration Visualization**: Interactive plots showing uncertainty vs actual accuracy correlation
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: EU AI Act Article 15 automated reporting demonstration
4. **Operational Decision-Making**: Concrete examples of how uncertainty scores guide production decisions
5. **Educational Exploration**: Tools to experiment with your own text and understand uncertainty behavior

## How to Use This Demo

1. **Select a Model**: Choose from pre-loaded transformer architectures
2. **Input Text**: Enter your own text or use provided examples
3. **Explore Uncertainty**: See real-time uncertainty scores and calibration metrics
4. **Compare Methods**: View PBA against baseline uncertainty methods
5. **Generate Reports**: Create compliance documentation for production use

## Educational Value

This demo positions the work correctly as:
- Essential infrastructure for current transformer deployment challenges
- Preparation for collecting behavioral data about uncertainty at scale
- Bridge toward future architectures where uncertainty becomes intrinsic
- Practical tool for understanding model reliability in operational contexts

## Scientific Context

Based on "Perplexity-Based Adjacency for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models" - this implementation resolves circular dependencies in current uncertainty methods by grounding adjacency definitions in learned probability distributions rather than arbitrary thresholds.

The community learns through experimentation - use these tools to explore how uncertainty quantification behaves with your specific models and datasets.
