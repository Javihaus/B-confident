# HuggingFace Space Deployment Guide

## Overview

This HuggingFace Space demonstrates **infrastructure for reliable deployment of current transformer architectures** with uncertainty quantification. The interactive demo positions B-Confident correctly as essential infrastructure for regulatory compliance and production reliability.

## Educational Positioning

**Scientific Honesty:** This work provides infrastructure for current transformer deployment challenges rather than fundamental AI advances. The community learns through experimentation - these tools enable exploration of uncertainty quantification behavior with specific models and datasets.

**Future Preparation:** Creates experimental infrastructure for collecting behavioral data about uncertainty quantification at scale - valuable preparation for future architectures where uncertainty representation becomes intrinsic rather than computed post-hoc.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. HuggingFace Space Setup

**Space Configuration:**
```yaml
title: B-Confident Uncertainty Quantification Demo
sdk: gradio
sdk_version: 4.44.0
python_version: 3.9
```

**Key Dependencies:**
```
gradio==4.44.0
torch>=1.9.0
